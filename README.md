## Newsletters:

[**Data Science Weekly**](https://www.datascienceweekly.org/)

Data Science Weekly is definitely a fan-favorite, and for good reason. The newsletter started in 2013 and has pumped out 276 consistent issues since. It starts off with an *Editor Picks* section and quickly moves onto listing a bunch of data science articles and videos. Furthermore, it includes a section for job openings, tutorials, and books as well. Sent every Thursday, this one is well worth your time. Check out a [recent issue](https://www.datascienceweekly.org/newsletters/data-science-weekly-newsletter-issue-276).

[**O’Reilly Data Newsletter**](https://www.oreilly.com/data/newsletter.html)

You have probably heard of [O’Reilly Media](https://www.oreilly.com/) in one way or another. Personally, I have a collection of their books sitting on my desk at all times. They also publish ebooks, host conferences, and offer other learning solutions. Their data-focused newsletter delivers 10 links each week that range from news to tutorials to white-papers.

[**Data Elixir**](https://dataelixir.com/)

Data Elixir takes a similar approach, breaking things down into a wide-ranging collection of weekly news, insights, tools & techniques, resources, and data visualization. The newsletter goes out to over 29,000 subscribers and is delivered every Tuesday. Check out a [recent issue](https://dataelixir.com/issue/?num=224).

[**Data Machina**](https://datamachina.substack.com/)

Data Machina is a more technical newsletter that breaks down links by technology, hitting on topics from R to blockchain to algorithms. There’s really a little bit of everything here. I subscribe to the free version, sent every two weeks but it looks like you can pay to receive the newsletter every week if you would like. Check out a [recent issue](https://datamachina.substack.com/p/data-machina-150).

[**The Analytics Dispatch**](https://mode.com/newsletter/)

[Mode](https://mode.com/business/) offers a number of enterprise data solutions, but they also put out a pretty good data newsletter every week. They primarily focus on articles that catch their eye around the community but also include a section for featured data jobs as well. Check out a [recent issue](https://mode.com/resources/analytics-dispatch/2019-03-11/).

[**Machine Learnings**](https://us10.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=6ee1802497b4ea1c66ce61da4&id=afa70be09a)

As you might have guessed, Machine Learnings focuses on ML and AI news primarily. I particularly enjoy the *Awesome* and *Not Awesome* sections that give bite-sized news if you’re in a rush. Others seem to like it as well, as the newsletter boasts 40,000+ subscribers. Check out a [recent issue](https://mailchi.mp/usejournal/machine-learnings-another-autonomous-vehicle-related-death?e=8489f0e7ea).

[**The Data Science Roundup**](http://roundup.fishtownanalytics.com/)

Another newsletter that has been around for some time, The Data Science Roundup has 177 published issues and over 7,000 subscribers to date. This newsletter takes a more concise approach, offering 5 or so links each week with an insightful reflection written on each article. Check out a [recent issue](http://roundup.fishtownanalytics.com/issues/generalists-or-specialists-transformer-models-time-to-migrate-your-pdts-designing-resilient-kpis-dsr-178-166781).

[**Hacker News Digest**](https://www.hndigest.com/)

Not a data science newsletter per se, but a valuable resource nonetheless. Like most people in tech, I love [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). However, I had a hard time keeping up with it, until I found this. You can dictate the frequency and amount of links that are sent to you based on the number of upvotes on each post.

[**Kaggle Newsletter**](https://us1.campaign-archive.com/?u=e4c8fb8b43860678deab268e5&id=c810091291&e=abeaa8fb3e)

This newsletter contains any recent blog posts, interviews, or news regarding [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), everyone’s favorite machine learning competition site. It also includes links, resources, meetups, and job openings around the community. I couldn’t find a subscribe link for this one, pretty sure Kaggle automatically subscribes you when you make an account.

[**Stratechery: The Daily Update**](https://stratechery.com/membership/)

Stratechery’s Daily Update is a little different than the others in that it’s a paid, daily membership. Not a traditional data science newsletter, these reports focus on tech strategy think-pieces. It’ll run you around $10/month, a little less if you pay yearly. This is one of the few places where I gladly pay for written content, [Medium being the other](https://medium.com/swlh/why-i-spend-5-monthly-on-medium-7092255476c4). There’s also plenty of free essays available on the site. Check out [this post](https://stratechery.com/2018/data-factories/?utm_campaign=Data_Elixir&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Data_Elixir_203) and others to get a feel for it.

[**Import AI**](https://us13.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=67bd06787e84d73db24fb0aa5&id=6c9d98ff2c)

Import AI leans heavily on technical machine learning and AI resources, often white-papers and recent research results. The issues also include an impressive amount of analysis. Even if none of that is your thing, make sure to read the *Tech Tales* section at the end for an always-interesting futuristic story. Check out a [recent issue](https://us13.campaign-archive.com/?u=67bd06787e84d73db24fb0aa5&id=444cb24955).

[**The Wild Week in AI**](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/wildml?utm_campaign=Issue&utm_content=profilename&utm_medium=email&utm_source=The+Wild+Week+in+AI)

Similar to Import AI, this newsletter covers technical machine learning and AI tutorials, projects, research papers, and news. Delivered a bit sporadically, The Wild Week in AI has over 17,000 subscribers if that’s any indication of the content. Check out a [recent issue](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/wildml/issues/the-wild-week-in-ai-83-tensorflow-dev-summit-highlights-world-models-cloud-text-to-speech-and-more-104034).

[**Data Is Plural**](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural)

Data Is Plural is delivered weekly, focusing solely on interesting datasets for you to explore or use in your next side-project. There’s also a pretty awesome [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0) that serves as the archive for all these datasets dating back to 2015. Check out a [recent issue](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2019-03-13-edition).

[**TDS Weekly Selection**](https://towardsdatascience.com/tagged/tds-letter)

Last but not least, the team at [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/) puts out both weekly and monthly digests of the most popular posts on the publication. You can receive these emails by accepting *Letters* from TDS if you go to the dropdown found on their homepage. Check out a [recent issue](https://towardsdatascience.com/weekly-selection-mar-15-2019-cbe5aa422a31).




## Project Inspiration:

[**Data is Beautiful**](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/)
I could spend hours just browsing this subreddit of data visualizations. You’ll be interested in all of the unique ideas and questions that people think up. There’s also monthly challenge where a dataset is chosen, and users are tasked with visualizing it in the most effective way possible. Sort by best all time for instant gratification.

[**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the poster child of online data science. There’s a couple ways to use Kaggle effectively for inspiration. First, you can look at the [trending datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and think of interesting ways to leverage the information. If you’re more interested in machine learning and the examples themselves, the [kernels feature](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels) has gotten better and better over time.

[**The Pudding**](https://pudding.cool/)
It really is true that visual essays are an emerging form of journalism. The Pudding embodies this movement like none other. The team uses original datasets, primary research, and interactivity in order to explore tons of interesting topics.

[**FiveThirtyEight**](https://fivethirtyeight.com/)
A classic, but still good to this day. I mean come on, [Nate Silver](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nate-silver/) is the man. The data-driven blog touches on everything from politics to sports to culture. Not to mention, they just revamped their much improved [data export](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/) page.

[**Towards Data Science**](https://towardsdatascience.com/)
Lastly, I’ve got to give a shoutout to the [TDS Team](https://towardsdatascience.com/u/7e12c71dfa81?source=post_page-----ea6afbe20319----------------------) for bringing together this community of smart people with a passion for achieving things and helping others grow in data science. Browsing recent stories will bring you more than a few interesting project ideas on any given day.
